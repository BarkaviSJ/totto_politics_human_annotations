# Error Annotations of our Human Evaluation
This repo contains the error annotation guidelines and sample annotations from our human evaluation experiment for the paper "Improving Factual Accuracy of Neural Table-to-Text Output by Addressing Input Problems in ToTTo"

To understand hallunication in neural model outputs at a more granular level, we adopted manual error annotation methodology from [Thomson and Reiter(2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.22/) and included specific error categories relevant for ToTTo Politics domain outputs. Definitions of error categories and guidelines are available [here](https://github.com/BarkaviSJ/totto_politics_human_annotations/blob/main/annotation_guidelines.docx). Example annotations from our human evaluation experiment is available [here](https://github.com/BarkaviSJ/totto_politics_human_annotations/blob/main/human_evaluation_annotations.docx).
